# LSTM

Edit `project` (netbeans, eclipse), `fold` (0 to 9) and paths in the following scripts and jupyter notebooks, then run each of them in order. Here, `fold` is the one test fold for the `project`. 9 other folds are used to train the model.

1. `small_corpus_tokenizer.py`: generate tokenizer.
2. `small_corpus_prepare_data.py`: generate training data.
3. `LSTM_model.ipynb`: train LSTM model.
4. `LSTM_test.ipynb`: test LSTM model.
